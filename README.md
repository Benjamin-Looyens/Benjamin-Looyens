My personal commit naming standards:
- `feat` : Significant addition/change to features of project
- `fix` : Fix to a bug, issue or otherwise unintended behavior in the code
- `chore` : Mundane addition to code (eg: adding scene information, comments, internal organization, etc)
- `lib` : Adding or removing external libraries
- `file` : Adding or removing of resource files
- `perf` : Code with same behavior, but optimized for better performance
- `org` : Change in project organization (changing directory structure, etc)
- `[x]/[y]` : Combination of any of the previous standards in the place of [x] and [y]
